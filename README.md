Ducci sequences based cryptosystem 

This is my attempt at a cryptosystem based on Ducci sequences (or n-number game/Diffy game). Based from the ElGamal and Cramer-Schoup public key cryptosystems. 

This was built for my Mathematics honours project.

Sorry if there are bad practices/poor computational efficiency, let me know how I can improve. Thanks!

The myfunctions.py file is where I write functions specific for my purpose (working in F_2[x])
