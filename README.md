Ducci sequences based cryptosystem 

This is my attempt at a cryptosystem based on Ducci sequences (or n-number game/Diffy game). So far, it is essentially the El gamal system, the specifics of which can be found easily on wikipedia.
This is being built for my mathematics honours project.

Sorry for the bad coding practices, let me know how I can improve. Thanks!

The myfunctions.py file is where I write functions specific for my purpose (working in F_2[x])
